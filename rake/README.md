## RAKE
RAKE short for Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction algorithm, is a domain independent keyword extraction algorithm which tries to determine key phrases in a body of text by analyzing the frequency of word appearance and its co-occurance with other words in the text.

## Setup

### Using pip

```bash
pip install rake-nltk
```

### Directly from the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/csurfer/rake-nltk.git
python rake-nltk/setup.py install
```

## Quick start

```python
from rake_nltk import Rake

# Uses stopwords for english from NLTK, and all puntuation characters by
# default
r = Rake()

# Extraction given the text.
r.extract_keywords_from_text(<text to process>)

# Extraction given the list of strings where each string is a sentence.
r.extract_keywords_from_sentences(<list of sentences>)

# To get keyword phrases ranked highest to lowest.
r.get_ranked_phrases()

# To get keyword phrases ranked highest to lowest with scores.
r.get_ranked_phrases_with_scores()
```

## Debugging Setup

If you see a stopwords error, it means that you do not have the corpus
`stopwords` downloaded from NLTK. You can download it using command below.

```bash
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('stopwords')"
```

## References

This is a python implementation of the algorithm as mentioned in paper [Automatic keyword extraction from individual documents by Stuart Rose, Dave Engel, Nick Cramer and Wendy Cowley](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Stuart_Rose/publication/227988510_Automatic_Keyword_Extraction_from_Individual_Documents/links/55071c570cf27e990e04c8bb.pdf)

## Why I chose to implement it myself?

- It is extremely fun to implement algorithms by reading papers. It is the digital equivalent of DIY kits.
- There are some rather popular implementations out there, in python([aneesha/RAKE](https://github.com/aneesha/RAKE)) and node([waseem18/node-rake](https://github.com/waseem18/node-rake)) but neither seemed to use the power of [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/). By making NLTK an integral part of the implementation I get the flexibility and power to extend it in other creative ways, if I see fit later, without having to implement everything myself.
- I plan to use it in my other pet projects to come and wanted it to be modular and tunable and this way I have complete control.
